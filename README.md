## E-Commerce Fraud Detection Model

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict fraudulent E-Commerce credit card transactions. The project utilizes simulated credit card data to explore the ability of machine learning to identify fraudulent E-Commerce credit card transactions. Success in this project could suggest that machine learning can be used to identify E-Commerce fraud, and could be used to save businesses and individuals from significant financial loss. 

## Project start
1. Start a new repository and select default README.md
2. Clone the repository to local environment. I Used VS Code to clone the repository. 
3. Open the project, create, and activate the virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install dependencies into the .venv
```bash
python3 -m pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
```
5. Freeze dependencies into requirements.txt
 ```bash
 python3 -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
